# Contributing

For setup and checks, see [Development](DEVELOPMENT.md). For image URLs and
options, see the [user documentation](https://qrnegie.andrew.cmu.edu/).

## Report a Problem

Check existing issues first. Include the image URL or options you used,
what happened and what you expected. For a QR code that doesn't scan, include
the phone or scanner app and the size it was printed or shown at.

For a feature request, describe the page or workflow it would help.
Discuss larger changes, such as a new style, in an issue before starting
implementation.

## Submit a Pull Request

Branch from `main` and open the pull request against `main`. Keep it
focused on one concern. Explain the problem, the resulting behavior and
how you checked the change.

Run the [checks](DEVELOPMENT.md#checks) before submitting and enable the
[pre-commit hooks](DEVELOPMENT.md#pre-commit-hooks). Add or update tests
when behavior changes. Update the options reference, the builder and the
MCP guide when changing a public image option or style.

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
for commit subjects.

## Code and Writing Style

Edit TypeScript in `src/`; `dist/` is generated and is not committed.
Browser scripts live in `docs/js/`. ESLint and Prettier use the checked-in
configuration; see [Linting and Formatting](DEVELOPMENT.md#linting-and-formatting).
One-line code comments are fragments without a period.

Follow the Web Kilt's [writing conventions](https://webkilt.andrew.cmu.edu/conventions.html)
for documentation and examples: AP style, Title Case for headings, buttons
and labels, and action verbs at the start of buttons and calls to action.
Use made-up content in examples, and Andrew Carnegie (ac00) for a person.
